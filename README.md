# Logistic Regression Model for University Admissions

## Project Overview
This project is a Python implementation of a logistic regression model to predict a student's probability of admission to a university based on their scores from two exams. It demonstrates the fundamental components of a machine learning classification model, built from scratch using NumPy.

The model learns a decision boundary from historical data to classify new applicants as either "Admitted" or "Not Admitted."

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate into the `university-admissions-model` directory.
3. Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
